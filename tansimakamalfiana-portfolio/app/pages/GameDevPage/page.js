            <p>Ever wondered what it is like to dive into the world of game development? Well, let me tell you about my adventure with an indie story mode game called Zomboid! My friend had this awesome idea for a game, and I could not resist jumping in to help bring it to life. Using 3D modeling tools, I unleashed my creativity to design layouts, characters, cosmetics, weapons, and all sorts of cool objects for the game. It was like being a mad scientist in a virtual laboratory, crafting the perfect elements to make the game pop! From brainstorming sessions to late-night modeling marathons, this project was an exhilarating ride filled with fun and creativity. And the best part? Seeing our ideas come to life in the game was an absolute thrill!</p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl text-center">Contribution </h2>
            <p>Mapping the 2D images from Photoshop onto a 3D model was quite a fascinating experience for me. Blender played a significant role in this process, allowing me to integrate these textured images onto the 3D model. With Blender real-time updates I could instantly see how my changes affected the model giving me a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment. This dynamic platform not only made the process more efficient but also enhanced my creativity by providing immediate feedback. Overall combining Photoshop and Blender opened up new possibilities for me in 3D design allowing me to bring my ideas to life in ways I had not imagined before. It was a bit challenging to learn at first but once I figured it out it was so much fun!</p>

              <p>This collaborative journey has been both challenging and rewarding. Designing for something outside of my degree field proved to be both a challenge and a delight. It pushed me to think outside of my comfort zone and explore new concepts. Through teamwork and perseverance, we&apos;ve crafted a amazing concepts that meets the needs of our project. As I continue to work on the remaining designs, I&apos;m excited to see the final product come together. Stay tuned for more updates on our progress!</p>
